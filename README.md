# appsdk
An experimental idea on buildkit for mobile apps

## Sample apps

why ?

- You need stuff for your CI pipelne to work against so you know it works.

Which ones ? 

DONT reinvent the wheel !!!!

- flutter
	- the standard one generated by the Flutter cli
- flutter plugin using golang. This is good:

	- https://github.com/renatoathaydes/go-hash
	- https://github.com/renatoathaydes/gohash_mobile_app
	- Instructions !!!!!
		- https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/buildingamobilefrontendforagoapplicationusingflutter

- gopherjs app using webview. Best practice is clearly this:
	- https://github.com/dave/jsgo
	- https://github.com/dave/play
	- Material Design for it: https://github.com/agamigo/vecty-material
		- SO you match the Fluuter Material Design.
	- DSL of html to vecty: https://github.com/dave/html2vecty
		- Because you can then generate from golang on Web, Desktop and Flutter using CMS pattern. Long story...

- Flux. You need a cross platform flux engine.
	- Shared between Flutter, Web and Desktop.
	- Really heavily related to the DSL / CMS aspects.
	- DRY. Golang drives the Flutter and Web, Desktop GUi using data driven configuration. 
	- This gets you maybe 90% code sharing between Flutter, Web and Desktop.



## Mage 

https://github.com/magefile/mage

why ?

- You need your build CLI to be cross platform 100%
- you can write steps as golang packages that you can import. Its nice.
- Many out there that others are using: https://github.com/search?l=Go&q=magefile%2Fmage&type=Code
- Mage can run in interpretted or non interpretted mode. You need both.

mage-base

- you need a base because mage is only one layer.
- this one is quite a good helper: https://github.com/zvelo/zmage
- example: https://github.com/zvelo/gopkgredir/blob/master/magefile.go


mage-dep-os-pkg

- you need your OSX and window setup in a repeatable indempotent way.
- This then is make part of a Mage package.
- This is really important. Too many reasons to explain why.

mage-flutter-pkg

- wraps the flutter cli, and adds some extra stuff needed.

mage-web-pkg

- For now just wrap things as you need.

mage-desktop-pkg

- Packing and Signing for Windows and Mac

mage-deploy

- There are many things that Flutter and Web and Desktop apps need here and shoudl be added here.

mage-cycle

- You need a way to quickly cycle / test / play with your apps that match real world conditions. 
- The best way is to use a proper reverse proxy tunnel
- Cloud FLares Argo is the easiest right now.
