An experimental idea on buildkit for mobile apps

## Sample apps

why ?

- You need stuff for your CI pipelne to work against so you know it works.

Which ones ? 

DONT reinvent the wheel !!!!

- flutter
	- the standard one generated by the Flutter cli
- flutter plugin using golang. This is good:

	- https://github.com/renatoathaydes/go-hash
	- https://github.com/renatoathaydes/gohash_mobile_app

- gopherjs app using webview. Best practice is clearly this:

## Mage 

https://github.com/magefile/mage

why ?

- You need your build CLI to be cross platform 100%
- you can write steps as golang packages that you can import. Its nice.
- Many out there that others are using: https://github.com/search?l=Go&q=magefile%2Fmage&type=Code
- Mage can run in interpretted or non interpretted mode. You need both.

mage-base

- you need a base because mage is only one layer.
- this one is quite a good helper: https://github.com/zvelo/zmage


mage-dep-os-pkg

- you need your OSX and window setup in a repeatable indempotent way.
- This then is make part of a Mage package.
- This is really important. Too many reasons to explain why.

mage-flutter-pkg

- wraps the flutter cli, and adds soem extra stuff needed

mage-web-pkg

- For now just wrap things as you need.

mage-deploy

- There are many things that Flutter and Web and Desktop apps need here and shoudl be added here.

mage-cycle

- You need a way to quickly cycle / test / play with your apps that match real world conditions. 
- The best way is to use a proper reverse proxy tunnel
- Cloud FLares Argo is the easiest right now.
